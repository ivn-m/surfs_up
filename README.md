 - While temperatures are slighly different between the two months, the average temperature seems to be relatively stable considering June being a summer month and December being a winter month.
 - While there is a 8 degree temperature difference between the minimum temperatures experienced in June and December, the maximum temperatures are relatively similar. 
 - Variability in temperature, presented by the standard deviation, is not so different between June and December. 

## Summary
-High-level summary: Given lack of weather variability, presented by temperatures in June and December, creating a surf and ice cream business in Oahu would be sustainable year round.
